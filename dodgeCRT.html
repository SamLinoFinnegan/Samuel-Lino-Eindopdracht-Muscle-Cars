                    The Dodge Charger SRT
                </h2>
                <h3>
                    As a modern-day muscle car, the Dodge Charger SRT is a great choice if you're seeking something
                    practical and good-looking. It has a slab-sided, retro design that creates a
                    classic-yet-contemporary look. When it comes to power, the 2017 Dodge Charger SRT is decidedly
                    practical, with a standard 292-hp V6 engine. Inside the cabin, there's plenty of room for five. For
                    the 2017 model year (the last with the SRT trim), the Charger boasts an upgraded infotainment system
                    and touchscreen paired with Apple CarPlay® and Android Auto™ capability. Standard and available
                    features for the 2017 Dodge Charger SE include:
