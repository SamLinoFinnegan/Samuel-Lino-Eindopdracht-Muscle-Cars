                    The classic Mustang Shelby GT

                <h3>
                    Songs have been sung and movies have been made about the Mustang Shelby GT, and for good reason: It
                    hits
                    the target with styling, power, and convenience. For the 2017 model year, the Mustang Shelby GT
                    offers a
                    5.0L V8 that puts out 435 hp, while the 2018-2019 Mustang Shelby GT boasts 460 hp. For the 2019
                    model year,
                    there's additional differentiation across the GT trim, with the introduction of the GT Premium and
                    the iconic Bullitt model. Across 2017-2019 model years, standard features on the Ford Mustang Shelby
                    GT
                    include:
