                    The 1960s and 1970s birthed the American muscle car scene, a beloved American pastime for those who
                    enjoy learning about the different car specs and a hobby for collectors who can afford it. This era
                    of power created some of the rarest and most iconic muscle cars packing giant torque-rich V-8s the
                    world has ever seen.
                </h3>

            <p>
                The American muscle car era ran, for the most part, from the mid ’60s through the early to mid ‘70s.
                This era, not surprisingly, coincides with American superiority in the Space Race (Apollo 11 landed
                Americans on the moon on July 20,1969), and is also widely considered to be the heyday of rock and roll,
                with artists such as Creedence Clearwater Revival, Jimi Hendrix, The Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin
                providing the soundtrack. As with these iconic images, one only has to hear the deep rumble from the
                dual exhaust of a 1970 Chevrolet Chevelle SS 454 to be immediately transported to a time when we felt
                that not only was anything possible for the good old USA, but that anything was possible for us as well.
